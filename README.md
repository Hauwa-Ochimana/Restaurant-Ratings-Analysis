# Restaurant-Ratings-Analysis
## Introduction
This project analyzes restaurant ratings and consumer preferences in Mexico. The goal was to uncover what drives high restaurant ratings, whether consumer preferences affect those ratings, and to identify opportunities in the market for new investments. The analysis seeks to answer key questions:
- What can you learn from the highest-rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences affect ratings?
- What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?
- Are there any demand & supply gaps that could be exploited in the market?
- If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you look for?

### Key Metrics
- Countries analyzed: 1 (Mexico)
- Cities covered: 4
- Restaurants analyzed: 130
- Consumers: 128
- Cuisines: 21
- Average overall rating: 1.20

### Skills Used
The following Power BI features were used;
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
- DAX Measures and Formulas
- Date Visualization
- Data Storytelling
  
### Analysis
- Highest Rated Restaurants: The highest-rated restaurants, such as Tortas Hawaii and Tortas Locas, achieved top ratings by offering cuisines aligned with consumer preferences, targeting high-demand dishes, and serving age groups with strong representation (notably 18–24).
- Consumer Preferences vs Ratings: Consumer preferences vs ratings show an interesting pattern: while Mexican cuisine had the highest overall demand among respondents, Sushi topped the average overall rating, indicating that high demand does not always translate to the highest satisfaction quality or experience plays a key role. Other top-rated cuisines by average rating include Breakfast and Tex-Mex, showing a strong link between consumer satisfaction and certain popular offerings.
- Demographics: The data sample is dominated by younger consumers (18–24), mostly students, which introduces bias in the data sample and in interpreting preferences. 
- Demand vs Supply Gap; (Cuisine Offered vs Cuisine Preferred): Mexican cuisine was over-supplied relative to consumer preference and demand whereas cuisines like Sushi were under-represented, highlighting opportunities for restaurants to optimize menu offerings to both meet demand and maximize satisfaction.

### Conclusion/Summary
Restaurants get higher ratings when their menu matches what customers like. In this data, most respondents are young students (18–24), so the results mainly reflect their preferences. Some cuisines, like Mexican, are very popular but not always rated the highest, while others, like Sushi, are rated very highly even if fewer people prefer them. This shows that both customer demand and quality of the cuisine affect ratings, and there are opportunities for restaurants to adjust menus to satisfy customers better.

### Recommendation
- Invest in restaurants that offer cuisines with high customer ratings, such as Sushi and Breakfast, even if they aren’t the most requested, to leverage quality and satisfaction.
- Target locations with a high concentration of young consumers, especially students aged 18–24, who make up the majority of respondents.
- Focus on mid-range pricing, as medium budget level aligns with the spending habits of the dominant consumer segment, 18-24.
